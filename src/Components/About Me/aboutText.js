I graduated from Indiana University in 2016 with a desire to work outdoors, see other places, and give back to the world. I volunteered for 2 months doing hurricane disaster relief in the U.S. Virgin Islands, then did a much longer stint with the Montana Conservation Corps in the remote wilderness. Along the way, I worked in landscaping and as a grower in a commercial greenhouse in the Indianapolis area. During that time, I began to teach myself how to code. I taught myself the basics of the C# programming language by building simple games using the Unity Engine.
